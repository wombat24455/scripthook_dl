# scripthook_dl

Scripthook_dl was a side project I created because I was too goddamn lazy to keep checking the scripthook website to see if Scripthook V had been updated to the latest version.

## How it works

It downloads the files from the [scripthook](http://www.dev-c.com/gtav/scripthookv/) website, separates Scripthook from all the useless crap that is not needed, deletes the folder it downloaded and notifies you depending on if it downloaded a new version of Scripthook or not.

Notification for when no new versions have been found:

Notification for when a new version has been found & downloaded:

## Usage

All you need to do is run the `start.bat` file and let it do its thing.
